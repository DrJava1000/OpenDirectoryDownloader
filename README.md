# OpenDirectoryDownloader
This repository holds a small script that I developed for downloading television shows and movies 
from open directories (OD) on the Internet. 

The script allows users to download either individual files
(or entire directories) from a user-specified list of open directory 
URLs. Thus, it allows users to download files from different sources in
a single job. 

This script also provides minimal logging facilities for each job in 
question.
